# Team Norms
## Team Values
## Any Conflict Issues
* If there are disagreements within the team: all team members will meet and discuss their thoughts. Once everyone has been able to discuss their thoughts and ideas, a vote will be taken on how the disagreement will be resolved. The Scrum Master will record which side won, while also taking into consideration the minority sides viewpoints. In the event of no majority vote, the Scrum Master and Product Owner will take into consideration everyone's viewpoints and develop a solution.
* If a team member is not adhering to team norms or completing their duties to the team: Other team members should notify the Scrum Master of the current situation. The Scrum Master should then meet with the individual to discuss their expectations of the individual and whether there are any issues blocking their progress. If this becomes a recurring issue with any individual, the Scrum Master may reach out to see if outside intervention is required.
## Scrum Duration
The duration of each sprint will be 2 weeks long to ensure that we are progressing at a steady pace and staying on task.
## Daily Standups
Daily standups will occur every Wednesday from 2:00pm to 2:30pm, where every member of the team is expected to be present. Members are not allowed to cover for a team member that is absent from the daily standup. A member who misses multiple daily standups without notifying team members prior to the meeting or members that have made no progress for more than two standups will be reported.
## Coding Standards
* All team members are expected to use *Visual Studio Code* and *Prettier*, the code formatter, which is an extension on visual studio code that can be downloaded
* Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed should pass tests before being merged into the main branch
* Make sure you are using the latest version of the code at all times
* Always push working code
* Make small commits for features or bug fixes
* Commits should be descriptive and concise messages
* Variable and functions should be meaningful and descriptive names
* Team members should push any changes they made back to GitHub at regular intervals - at least once between standup meetings.

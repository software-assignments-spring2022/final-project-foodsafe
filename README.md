# FoodSafe
## What and Why?
FoodSafe is a software app that will allow its user to select which allergies they may have, such as: milk, eggs, peanuts, soy, wheat, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, sesame, etc. Then the user will be able to search for a food product and the app will then suggest food products that are allergy free and safe for the user to eat. The team is aiming for the app to initially ask users what they are allergic to, then to be directed to a page where users can search for food products that are allergy free and the software will suggest them. Later on, our goals are to add more allergies than just the common ones, and allow the user to enter a full grocery list that the app will be able to process. This software will help those with allergies that struggle to find foods they can eat and spend hours in grocery stores looking at the ingredients on the back of products.
## How FoodSafe Became an Idea
This project started because I have many allergies and often struggle with finding food products that I can safely eat. I am constantly reading tshe ingredients on the back of food products which makes grocery shopping a long and tedious process. Recognizing that I am not the only one that struggles with this, we decided to create an app that will allow users with food allergies to search for food products with ease.

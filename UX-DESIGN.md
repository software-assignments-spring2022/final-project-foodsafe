# User Experience Design
The prototype contains a welcome screen where you can navigate to any page that you choose. First, you click select allergy, where you have 
the option to select any number of allergies. After that, you can search for a food type. We have popular types listed. If you are a returning
user you can navigate directly to the recommended products page using the homescreen. We will use your previously entered products
to give you a list of recommended products. Finally we give you a list of products that are friendly to someone with the allergies
that were entered.
This repository contains instructions and files for two assignments that together comprise the user experience design phase of a web app.

Replace the contents of this file with the completed assignments, as described in:

- [app map & wireframe instructions](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md).
